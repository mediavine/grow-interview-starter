# grow-interview-starter

This repository contains a starter template for the Mediavine Grow team's coding exercise.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository

   git clone https://github.com/mediavine/grow-interview-starter.git
   ```

1. Install node >=16 if not already installed
1. Run `npm install`
